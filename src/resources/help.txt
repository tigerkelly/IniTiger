This is a GUI Editor for .ini type files.

This program features are:
    - Can edit multiple files at once.
    - Can have comments per key/value pair.
    - Can edit/add/delete Sections.
    - Can edit/add/delete key/value pairs.

To remove a section right click section title bar to get menu.

An Ini file contains any number of sections and each section contains
key/value pairs.

A section name can be any printable character except the [ and ] 
characters and any length.

A Key can be any printable except the = and # characters with any length.

A Value can be any printable character except the # sign with any length.

The Section and Key parts are case sensitive.

A comment start with a # sign and goes to the end of line.  Comments can
follow section names and Values.  With Values any whitespace between Value
and the # sign are removed.

The comments are not saved and may disappear from the Ini file as the
Ini file is saved.

The only way to keep comments for Key/Value pairs is to store them in
a comment section.

The IniTiger program allows you to enter a comment per key/value pair
but the comment is kept in a section called 'SectionName'-Comments, 
see example.

An example of a section with 2 key/value pairs.

[Section One]
> Key one = Value one
> Key two = Value two
	
[Section Two]
> Key one = Value one
> Key two = Value two
> Key three = Value three

[Section One-Comments]
> Key one = The comment for key/value pair 'Key one' in section 'Section One'

[Section Two-Comments]
> Key two = The comment for key/value pair 'Key two' in section 'Section Two'
> Key three = The comment for key/value pair 'Key three' in section 'Section Two'
	
The comment section is not a standard of an Ini file but my own idea.
